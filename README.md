**Stopwatch**

Count the time you spend working or taking a break during a session.
It keeps counting even if you turn off your phone to keep maximum focus.

And also a bar chart to see your work evolution throughout the last week or month.

A little bit of information about the app.



» **WHY IS IT A BETA VERSION?** «

It's a new app and we are also new developers. It may have bugs and we don't want to fool any client saying you can totally trust it already. When we think it's good enough, then we stop calling it "beta".

We also want to add some other functionalities to call it 1.0:
- Tags with colors associated.
- An option to make a session counts on the day before for statistics. (Useful when you start working past midnight.)
- Import and export data. (For backups or when you switch phones.)
- A manual way to add and describe a session, when you forget to activate OriStats.
- Settings, for you to personalize some things.
- More and better graphics and statistics.
